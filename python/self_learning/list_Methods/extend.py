# Beginner Scenario
# Suppose you have a list of colors, and you want to add more colors to the list.

colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]

# To add the colors yellow and orange to the list, we can use the extend() function.

colors.extend(["yellow", "orange"])

print(colors)

# After using the extend() function, the colors list now contains the colors red, blue, green, yellow, and orange.

#Real World Scenario
# Suppose you have a list of items in a shopping cart, and you want to add more items to the list.

shopping_cart = ["milk", "bread", "eggs"]

# To add the items orange juice and cereal to the list, we can use the extend() function.

shopping_cart.extend(["orange juice", "cereal"])

print(shopping_cart)

# After using the extend() function, the shopping_cart list now contains the items milk, bread, eggs, orange
