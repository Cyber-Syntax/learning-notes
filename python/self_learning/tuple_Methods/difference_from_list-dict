Mutation:    
The biggest difference between tuples and the other two data types is 
    that tuples are immutable, while lists and dictionaries are mutable. 
    This means that once you create a tuple, you cannot change the values 
    it contains: you cannot add, remove, or modify the values of any element 
    in the tuple. On the other hand, you can modify the values in a list or 
    dictionary by adding, removing, or modifying elements.

Indexing: 
Both tuples and lists are sequence types, which means that you 
    can access their elements using indexing. However, dictionaries are not sequence 
    types, so you cannot access their elements using indexing. Instead, you use keys 
    to look up values in a dictionary.

Order: 
Both tuples and lists are ordered collections of elements, which means 
    that the elements are stored in a specific order and you can access them using 
    their index. Dictionaries, on the other hand, are unordered collections 
    of key-value pairs, so the elements are not stored in any particular order.

Syntax: 
Tuples and lists are both created using square brackets, 
    but tuples use parentheses: (1, 2, 3) is a tuple, while [1, 2, 3] is a list. 
    Dictionaries are created using curly braces: {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'} 
    is a dictionary.
